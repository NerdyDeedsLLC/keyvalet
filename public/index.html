                There once was a Dev from East Mass.,<br>
                While intending his code might be passed,<br>
                Feeling most license types<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   weren't worth all the hype,<br>
                Wrote his own as an iconoclast.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                His peers thought him a narcissist,<br>
                To think his could reside 'mongst 
                <a href="https://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank">the list</a>.<br>
                But once fully conceived,<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; whate'er believed,<br>
                Still manages to get Legal pissed.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                For he knew that he'd hit on the trick:<br>
                On how make his license stick:<br>
                "It should make lawyers pallid<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  (but be legally valid),<br>
                And be self-referential as shit!"<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                So you found this repo at last...<br>
                And it might help accomplish your task.<br>
                Now your quandary at hand<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  is its author's demand<br>
                You "must leave this notice attached"!?<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                This license is designed to be<br>
                A way to ensure that ('least for me!),<br>
                Should it screw your site up<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   I can not give a fuck;<br>
                I'm exempt from liability.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                It's not that I don't care; I do!<br>
                Use as source, even make revenue.<br>
                Just keep this bit intact<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   (be the source changed or hacked),<br>
                And you may treat it like MPL2.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                You're thus granted, worldwide & free,<br>
                Rights to use it for sale or I.P.<br>
                But with that notwithstanding<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  it's with the understanding,<br>
                It's "as-is" (and sans pledge/warranty).<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Should trademark/copyright abuse<br>
                Come from your violating Fair Use:<br>
                Since, along with the rest,<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  There's no promise expressed;<br>
                This paper shield serves as my excuse.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Code you've written on top remains yours,<br>
                So long as you/your devs have ensured<br>
                That which came from me,<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   is available, free,<br>
                And this verbatim license endures.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Your rights to this license get tossed,<br>
                If this Open Source notice gets lost.<br>
                If a lawsuit ensues<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  due to any abuse,<br>
                It's on you to pay my legal costs.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                So why the rude license in verse?<br>
                'Tis thoughts of some developer's mirth!<br>
                I find myself all smiley<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   (albeit infantile-y)<br>
                At aggravating corporate stuffed shirts.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Plus years from now, 'cross time & space<br>
                Once my consciousness's code's been erased<br>
                Some Dev, far from here,<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;   may snort as it appears,<br>
                From within some enterprise codebase<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Picture his boss as he opines,<br>
                "Our license's no good, sans these lines.<br>
                I COULD spend a few sprints<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  (though'd be time poorly spent)<br>
                Recoding it (what you decide'll be fine!)."<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Mr. Manager, I hope that it's clear:<br>
                That you MUST see this notice appears.<br>
                To the Dev: hold your ground.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  In three decades I've found<br>
                wasting money's their primary fear.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Now I've no doubt that there will be some,<br>
                Who think such immaturity dumb.<br>
                But those few folk (like me!),<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  who give out this stuff, free<br>
                May well see where I'm coming from.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                After all, it's a pretty safe bet:<br>
                Nerd cred's all the thanks that I'll get.<br>
                Plus telling my grandson (3)<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  that his old grandpappy<br>
                Once played keyboard for the Internet.<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                Thus I hope in my code you've found worth.<br>
                And in these words equivalent mirth.<br>
                For we must stick together<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  (Open Source dictates whether<br>
                The geek truly inherit the earth).<br>
            </spanza>
            <spanza>
                In truth all I seek's credit due,<br>
                Without some jerk asserting it's new.<br>
                So 'fore making the claim,<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was done in your name,<br>
                Know I use Git/StackOverflow, too.
